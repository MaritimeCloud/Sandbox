Maritime Cloud Technical Specification
======================

This repository contains the Maritime Cloud Technical Specification. 

The specification is written using AsciiDoctor syntax (a dialect of AsciiDoc) which is similar to other document markup languages such as LaTeX or DocBook.
However the syntax is easier to remember and the rendering of documents is much faster.


Prerequisites
==
Install AsciiDoctor using this guide http://asciidoctor.org/#installation
