  MSDL (Grammar and shit)

      BINARY (The Maritime Cloud compact binary encoding (CBE) CBE));
        is a format for encoding
        structural data messages. The format is designed to be
        • simple - it tries to minimize the number of encoding
          artifacts, primitive constructs, and the ways they can be
          combined,
        • efficient - encoders and decoders can be efficiently
            implemented in software or hardware,
        • and compact - encoded messages are reasonably
             compact due to the extensive use of variable-length
             coded data fields and the lack of inline meta data.
        • forward - to allow future extensions
