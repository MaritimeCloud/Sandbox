== Broadcasting
The concept of _broadcasting_ is well known from AIS. At regular intervals vessels must broadcast safety-related information to surrounding vessels. In its essence broadcasting is sending a single message out into the void. Where someone might receive the message that was sent.

This chapter describes the two types of messages involved with broadcasting in the maritime cloud:
* *Broadcast* Which is the actual broadcast message. Containing some kind of payload that are typically delivered to clients that are geographical close.
* *BroadcastAck* Which is a message that *can* be send from the receiver of a broadcast to the original sender of the broadcast. A broadcast ack is only send if the sender of the broadcast requests it.

The two broadcast messages are protocol agnostic. And can be transported on both radio based protocols such as NavDat or using the Maritime Messaging Service. 

=== Broadcast
First lets describe the contents of a broadcast message which consists of a number of header fields and a single payload.

[cols="3,7", options="header"]
|===
|Id
|Name
|Description

|1
|messageId
|The id of the message (optional). The id of a message is a unique id for each message that is broadcast. It is generated by applying a high quality hash  function (SHA256) on most of the header fields of the message. Hereunder sender id, timestamp, current position and message contents. Changing any field of the message will result in a different id. The reason the id is optional is that it can always be recreated anywhere by applying the same hash function to the contents of the message.

|2
|broadcastType
|The broadcast type of a message. Is a string based representation of the type of message being sent. The broadcast type refers to a MSDL definition registered in the central Service Registry. This definition details the format of the payload and how it can be decoded.

|3
|senderId
|The unique maritime id of the sender of the broadcast. The sender of the message should be registered in the Identity Registry.

|4
|senderTimestamp
|The current time of the sender when sending the broadcast. The format is  number of seconds that have elapsed since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970

|5
|senderPosition
|The current (best-effort) position of the sender when sending the broadcast (Optional). The field is required for vessels. But optional for landbased entities that do not have a position.

|6
|payload
|The actual contents of the broadcast. Encoded as per the definition of the broadcast type in the central Service Registry.

|7
|ackBroadcast
|Whether or not recipiants of the broadcast should acknowledge they have received the broadcast. This is done by sending a BroadcastAck as described in the next section.
  
|9
|signature
|An optional signature of the message using the senders private key. The contents of this message can be later be verified by applying the senders public key. Which should be available in the almanac.

|10
|An optional area to broadcast the message in.
|The area in which a broadcast should be delivered. This field only makes sense for certain low-level protocols such as MMS. More work to do on this.
Might make sense to have areas not defined by polygons but name/id.

==== Sending a broadcast message


==== Receiving a broadcast message.

if the field *ackBroadcast* is true a BroadcastAck *must* be send.


==== Hashing and Signing a Broadcast Message
binary concatenation


=== BroadcastAck
The broadcast ack is a message send from the receiver of a broadcast containing the original message id of the broadcast.

|Id
|Name
|Description

|1
|messageId
|The id of this message (not the broadcast message that was received) (optional). The id of a message is a unique id for each message that is broadcast. It is generated by applying a high quality hash  function (SHA256) on most of the header fields of the message. Hereunder sender id, timestamp, current position and message contents. Changing any field of the message will result in a different id. The reason the id is optional is that it can always be recreated anywhere by applying the same hash function to the contents of the message.

|2
|ackForMessageId
|The broadcast id of the broadcast being acknowledged.

|3
|originalSenderId
|The maritime id of the original sender of the broadcast (optional).

|4
|receiverId
|The maritime id of the receiver of the broadcast. Which is also the one that sends this message.

|5
|receiverTimestamp
|The local time at the receiver when the broadcast was received (optional).

|6
|receiverPosition
|The position of the receiver when the broadcast was received (optional).

|9
|signature
|An optional signature of the message using the senders private key. The contents of this message can be later be verified by applying the senders public key. Which should be available in the almanac.
